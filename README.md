# Genetically Accurate ClanGen

### [Original Game Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rnFQqyPZ7K) || [Original Game Itch.io Page](https://sablesteel.itch.io/clan-gen-fan-edit)

### Mod Currently Updated to: Version 9.4
This mod follows the stable version and thus may have issues with add-ons made for the development version. This mod will also conflict with mods that alter cat sprites, though any mods that alter accessories should be fine.

### W.I.P Base Package: Includes new genetically accurate colors, accurate descriptions, and accurate torties in game. Wildcards will exist as chimeras

### W.I.P Genetically Accurate Package: Includes all of the above as well as coding to make kits born as genetically accurate as possible
